# Godot Editor Scripts Dock

This plugin adds a new dockable panel that contains a list of all open scripts with a couple of handy features. It can be especially useful when you have limited screen real-estate and would like to give your script editor as much space as possible, but would still want to access the list of open scripts.

It also adds the name of the currently edited script to the bottom area of the script editor.

## Know limitations
Due to missing plugin API there is currently no way to access currently opened documentation pages. As such, this plugin cannot display them in the same manner. You still have access to the classic scripts panel from the script editor, so you can work with documentation pages the old way.

Most of the context menu features of the classic panel are also amiss, which can be improved in future versions. Manual sorting and last access heat indication are not implemented.
